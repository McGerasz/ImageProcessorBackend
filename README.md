<h1>ImageProcessorBackend</h1>

<h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
<p>If you wish to rebuild the C++ project you have to change the path variables in the properties of the project so that they match the required paths on your machine. </br>After that you have to put the newly created dll file into the folder ImageProcessorBackend/ in order for the API to function properly.
</br>The debug version of the opencv library was used in the C++ project.
</br>When starting the API select the http profile.
